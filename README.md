# Overview 

The purpose of the analysis is to provide information about temperature trends in the months of June and December in Oahu. The analysis is needed to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Using Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy I filtered the date column and measurements table in the Hawaii.sqlite database to retrieve all the temperatures for the months of June and December. Then the temperatures were converted into a list, a DataFrame was created, and summary statistics were generated. 

# Results 

•	The lowest temperature in June was 64 degrees and the lowest temperature in December was 56 degrees. A difference of 8 degrees. 

•	June had a mean temperature of 74.94 degrees and December had a mean temperature of 71.04 degrees

•	The max temperature for June was 85 degrees and the max temperature of December was 83 degrees

# Summary

Looking at the data provided it appears that opening the surf and ice cream shop year-round would be successful. There aren’t any large differences between the summary statistics for each month other than the count. However, there are other things besides temperature that the analysis does not show. Other queries that could be run would include one to show how often it rains in December compared to June. Another query to run would be peak seasons for tourists and how that could affect the surf and ice cream business.
